Resume dari dinamycal system and itsaplication</h1>

sebetetulnya kalau kita bicara tentang system dalam teorinya dimnana system tersebut menggambar sesusatuyang dinamis yang dia berubah terhadap waktu ,walaupun namanya dan ekossistem system dinamik yang dipakai pada prakteknya yang dimodelkan dan di analisa tidak selau funsi dari waktu saja, tapi juga bisa berfungsi sebagai dari ruang yang kita analisa seakan akan dia adalah fungsinya . bagi saya pribadi da sebuah buku yang tidak ada di indonisia dimna biuku ini menjelaskan dan menggambarfkan dan mendiskusikan tentang geometri dan penjelasnya lengkap dengan gambar bentukannya. contoh sebelum kita masuk kedalam aplikasi dalam riset yang dilakukan pertama kali dalam secara sejarah munculnya teori itu dari orang orang fisika yang berangkat dari model fisika tersebut sehingga menjadi dasar dari teori dalam ekosistem dan akhirnya berkambang. Many people regard French mathematician Henri Poincaré as the founder of dynamical systems.[9] Poincaré published two now classical monographs, "New Methods of Celestial Mechanics" (1892–1899) and "Lectures on Celestial Mechanics" (1905–1910). In them, he successfully applied the results of their research to the problem of the motion of three bodies and studied in detail the behavior of solutions (frequency, stability, asymptotic, and so on). These papers included the Poincaré recurrence theorem, which states that certain systems will, after a sufficiently long but finite time, return to a state very close to the initial state.

Aleksandr Lyapunov developed many important approximation methods. His methods, which he developed in 1899, make it possible to define the stability of sets of ordinary differential equations. He created the modern theory of the stability of a dynamical system.

In 1913, George David Birkhoff proved Poincaré's "Last Geometric Theorem", a special case of the three-body problem, a result that made him world-famous. In 1927, he published his Dynamical Systems. Birkhoff's most durable result has been his 1931 discovery of what is now called the ergodic theorem. Combining insights from physics on the ergodic hypothesis with measure theory, this theorem solved, at least in principle, a fundamental problem of statistical mechanics. The ergodic theorem has also had repercussions for dynamics.
Stephen Smale made significant advances as well. His first contribution was the Smale horseshoe that jumpstarted significant research in dynamical systems. He also outlined a research program carried out by many others.

Oleksandr Mykolaiovych Sharkovsky developed Sharkovsky's theorem on the periods of discrete dynamical systems in 1964. One of the implications of the theorem is that if a discrete dynamical system on the real line has a periodic point of period 3, then it must have periodic points of every other period.

In the late 20th century, Palestinian mechanical engineer Ali H. Nayfeh applied nonlinear dynamics in mechanical and engineering systems.[10] His pioneering work in applied nonlinear dynamics has been influential in the construction and maintenance of machines and structures that are common in daily life, such as ships, cranes, bridges, buildings, skyscrapers, jet engines, rocket engines, aircraft and spacecraft.  -->
